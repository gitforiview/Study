Scanning procedure in Wlan:
===========================
Several parameters are used in the scanning procedure. These parameters may be
specified by the user; many implementations have default values for these
parameters in the driver.

- BSSType
- BSSID
- SSID
- ScanType
- ChannelList
- ProbeDelay
- MinChannelTime and MaxChannelTime


BSSType (independent, infrastructure, or both)
----------------------------------------------
Scanning can specify whether to seek out independent ad hoc networks,
infrastructure networks, or all networks.

BSSID (individual or broadcast)
-------------------------------
The device can scan for a specific network to join (individual) or for any
network that is willing to allow it to join (broadcast). When 802.11 devices
are moving, setting the BSSID to broadcast is a good idea because the scan
results will include all BSSs in the area.

SSID ("network name")
---------------------
The SSID assigns a string of bits to an extended service set. Most products
refer to the SSID as the network name because the string of bits is commonly
set to a human-readable string. Clients wishing to find any network should
set this to the broadcast SSID.

ScanType (active or passive)
----------------------------
Active scanning uses the transmission of Probe Request frames to identify
networks in the area. Passive scanning saves battery power by listening for
Beacon frames.

ChannelList
-----------
Scans must either transmit a Probe Request or listen on a channel for the
existence of a network. 802.11 allows stations to specify a list of channels
to try. Products allow configuration of the channel list in different ways.
What exactly constitutes a channel depends on the physical layer in use.
With direct-sequence products, it is a list of channels.
With frequency-hopping products, it is a hop pattern.

ProbeDelay
----------
This is the delay, in microseconds, before the procedure to probe a channel
in active scanning begins. This delay ensures that an empty or lightly loaded
channel does not completely block the scan.

MinChannelTime and MaxChannelTime
---------------------------------
These values, specified in time units (TUs), specify the minimum and
maximum amount of time that the scan works with any particular channel.

There are two types of scanning: Passive scan and Active scan

Passive Scan:
-------------
Passive scanning saves battery power because it does not require transmitting.
In passive scanning, a station moves to each channel on the channel list
and waits for Beacon frames. Any Beacons received are buffered to extract
information about the BSS that sent them.
In the passive scanning procedure, the station sweeps from channel to channel
and records information from any Beacons it receives. Beacons are designed to
allow a station to find out everything it needs to match parameters with the
basic service set (BSS) and begin communications.

Active Scan:
------------
In active scanning, a station takes a more assertive role. On each channel,
Probe Request frames are used to solicit responses from a network with a
given name. Rather than listening for that network to announce itself,
an active scan attempts to find the network. Stations using active scanning
employ the following procedure for each channel in the channel list:
- Move to the channel and wait for either an indication of an incoming frame
  or for the ProbeDelay timer to expire. If an incoming frame is detected,
  the channel is in use and can be probed. The timer prevents an empty channel
  from blocking the entire procedure; the station won't wait indefinitely for
  incoming frames.
- Gain access to the medium using the basic DCF access procedure and send
  a Probe Request frame.
- Wait for the minimum channel time, MinChannelTime, to elapse.
  - If the medium was never busy, there is no network. Move to the next
    channel.
  - If the medium was busy during the MinChannelTime interval, wait until
    the maximum time, MaxChannelTime, and process any Probe Response frames.
Probe Response frames are generated by networks when they hear a Probe Request
that is searching for the extended service set to which the network belongs.
Probe Request frames can also use a broadcast SSID, which triggers a
Probe Response from all 802.11 networks in the area.
One station in each BSS is responsible for responding to Probe Requests.
The station that transmitted the last Beacon frame is also responsible for
transmitting any necessary Probe Response frames. In infrastructure networks,
the access points transmit Beacons and thus are also responsible for
responding to itinerant stations searching the area with Probe Requests.
IBSSs may pass around the responsibility of sending Beacon frames, so the
station that transmits Probe Response frames may vary. Probe Responses are
unicast management frames and are therefore subject to the positive
acknowledgment requirement of the MAC.
It is common for multiple Probe Responses to be transmitted as a result of
a single Probe Request. The purpose of the scanning procedure is to find
every basic service area that the scanning station can join, so a broadcast
Probe Request results in a response from every access point within range.
Any overlapping independent BSSs may also respond.

The relationship between the transmission of Probe frames and the various
timing intervals that can be configured as part of a scan.
- The scanning station transmits the Probe Request after gaining access to
  the medium. Both access points respond with a Probe Response that reports
  their network's parameters. Note that the second Probe Response is subject
  to the rules of the distributed coordination function and must wait for
  the contention window to elapse before transmitting.
- The first response is transmitted before the minimum response time elapses,
  so the station waits until the maximum response time has elapsed before
  collating the results. In areas with a large number of networks, it may
  be necessary to adjust the maximum channel time so the responses from all
  the access points in the area can be processed.

Scan Report:
------------
A scan report is generated at the conclusion of a scan. The report lists all
the BSSs that the scan discovered and their parameters. The complete parameter
list enables the scanning station to join any of the networks that it
discovered. In addition to the BSSID, SSID, and BSSType, the
parameters also include:[*]
[*] The items actually exposed by any particular software vary.

Beacon interval (integer): Each BSS can transmit Beacon frames at its own
                           specific interval, measured in TUs.

DTIM period (integer): DTIM frames are used as part of the powersaving
                       mechanism.

Timing parameters: Two fields assist in synchronizing the station's timer to
                   the timer used by a BSS. The Timestamp field indicates the
                   value of the timer received by the scanning station; the
                   other field is an offset to enable a station to match timing
                   information to join a particular BSS.

BSSBasicRateSet: The basic rate set is the list of data rates that must be
                 supported by any station wishing to join the network.
                 Stations must be able to receive data at all the rates listed
                 in the set. The basic rate set is composed of the mandatory
                 rates in the Supported Rates information element of
				 management frames.

PHY parameters, CF parameters, and IBSS parameters: These three facets of the
network have their own parameter sets. Channel information is included in the
physical-layer parameters.

FAQ's [Scanning procedure]:
---------------------------
a.   Difference between Direct prob and Null/Broadcast prob request ?
Ans: Direct prob request: A client station that is looking for a specific
                          SSID sends a probe request with the SSID field set
                          to the specific SSID. If a directed probe request
                          is sent, all APs that support that specific SSID
                          and hear the request should reply by sending a
                          probe response.
     Null/Broadcast prob request: A client station that is looking for any
                          SSID sends a probe request with the SSID field set
                          to null. If a null probe request is sent, all APs
                          that hear the request should reply by sending a
                          probe response.

b.   Difference between Beacon frame and Probe response frame ?
Ans: The information that is contained inside the body of a probe response
     frame is the same information that can be found in a beacon frame, with
     the exception of the traffic indication map (TIM).

c.   Why we need two types of scanning (Active/Passive) ?
Ans: Passive scan can not find the networks which is configured and enabled
     as hidden ssid but it can scan DFS channel. Active scanning can find
     the hidden network by direct probe request/response.

2.   What is dfs, how it works? What is slave dfs and master dfs ?
Ans: Wi-Fi networks operate in areas of RF spectrum that require no licence
     to operate. One particular service that shares spectrum with wireless
     LANs is radar. Some types of radar installation operate in the 5GHz band
     that is used by Wi-Fi network. This means that they may use some of the
     same frequencies that are used for Wi-Fi networks. This doesn’t apply to
     all radar stations that have been deployed; there are many radar
     installations do not use 5GHz.
     However, due to the coexistence of both radar and Wi-Fi networks in the
     same area of spectrum, the Wi-Fi standard (IEEE 802.11, and dfs added
     as WiFi regulatory specification amendmen 80211h) was designed to
     incorporate a spectrum sharing mechanism on 5GHz to ensure that Wi-Fi
     networks do not operate on frequencies (hence causing interference)
     that are used by nearby radar stations. This mechanism is known as
     Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) and is designed to mitigate
     interference to 5GHz radar by WLANs.

     How Does DFS Work?
     The main purpose of DFS is to avoid WLAN systems interference with Radar
     systems. If WLAN AP detects a Radar on current operating channel it
     should move to another non Radar detected channel by following set of
     DFS rules and the STA associated to that AP must move to the channel
     designated by AP.

     DFS parameters:
        Parameters                              value
        --------------------------------------------------
        Channel Availability check              60sec
        Channel move time                       10sec
        Channel Closing Transmission Time       1sec
        Non-Occupancy Period                    30minutes
        In-Service Monitoring

     Channel Availability check: Before an AP will use a channel that may be
     impacted by radar, it will perform a “Channel Availability Check” to
     check for radar signals on that channel. The AP will listen for
     60 seconds for the presence of radar signals. If no radar is detected,
     then the channel is designated as being an “Available Channel”.

     In-Service Monitoring: Once an AP is operating on a DFS channel, it has
     to monitor for the presence of radar signals appearing on that channel.
     This is known as “In-Service Monitoring”.
     The AP must continuously monitor its channel for the presence of radar
     signals. If a radar signal is detected, then the AP must cease
     transmissions on the channel within the “Channel Move Time”, which is
     10 seconds in the EU/UK.
     At the end of this period, the AP will have ceased transmissions and
     moved to a new channel.
     Prior to moving channels, some WLAN solutions may provide a
     “Channel Switch Announcement” 802.11 frame to connected clients to
     advise them which channel the AP will be moving to. Support for this on
     both WLAN infrastructure and client equipment seems to be optional from
     my own observations and should not be relied upon as a reliable method
     for clients to find the AP on its new channel.
     Experience shows that there are variations between WLAN solutions around
     which channels an AP will choose to move to when radar is detected. In
     some solutions, APs that detect radar will move to channel 36
	 exclusively. In other solutions, APs will choose to move to any of the
	 available non-DFS channels. Some will jump to any available 5GHz channel
	 they find (DFS or non-DFS). Behaviour in this area seems to be
	 inconsistent and is not defined within the 802.11 standard.

     Non-Occupancy Period: Once radar has been detected on a channel, then
     the “Non-Occupancy Period” begins. This is a 30-minute period in which
     no further transmissions will be made by the AP on the affected channel.
     At the end of the 30-minute period, most APs will attempt to return to
     their original channel, subject to a channel availability check.
     (Again behaviour in this area varies between vendors)

     Are All 5GHz Channels Subject to DFS?
     No, not all channels in the 5GHz band are subject to DFS. The channels
     that are exempt vary from country to country, as dictated by local
     regulations.
     DFS is applicable on 5GHz channels. The 5GHz band is divided into several
     sections referred to Unlicensed information infrastructure (UNII).
     UNII-1 band is designated for indoor operations.
     UNII-2 and UNII-2e (extended band) for indoor and outdoor operations.
     UNII-3 is intended mainly for Radar products and may be used as indoor
     for long distance RF links WLAN as well.

     Band	      DFS	          Channel	  Frequency (MHz)
     ------------------------------------------------------
     U-NII-1		              36 – 48	  5170 – 5250
     U-NII-2A	  DFS required	  52 – 64	  5250 – 5330
     U-NII-2C	  DFS required    100 – 140	  5490 – 5710
     U-NII-3		              149 – 165	  5735 – 5835


3.   What is Channel switch announcement
Ans: Once AP detects radar on operating channel, CSA element ID will be
     included in beacons and probe response to instruct the STA to move to
     new channel. CSA Element ID is shown in below figure.
      __________________________________________________________________
     |         |        |                |             |                |
     | Element | Length | Channel switch | New channel | Channel switch |
     |   ID    |        |      mode      |    Number   |      count     |
     |_________|________|________________|_____________|________________|
         1        1             1             1               1

     The slave device should respond to C.S.A element by checking its
     parameters.
      - If Channel switch mode is SET slave device shall stop transmit to AP
      - If Channel switch mode is CLEAR slave doesn't have any dependency on
        AP for its operation.

     Length : set to 3 bytes
     Channel Switch Mode : Indicates any restrictions on transmission until a
     channel switch. An AP in a BSS or a STA in an IBSS sets the Channel
	 Switch Mode field to either 0 or 1 on transmission. In an IBSS, the
	 Channel Switch  Mode Field is reserved.
     New Channel Number: set to the number of the channel to which the STA
     is moving.
     Channel Switch Count: for nonmesh STAs, this  field either is set to the
     number of TBTTs until the STA sending the Channel Switch Announcement
     element switches to the new channel or is set to 0. A value of 1
	 indicates that the switch occurs immediately before the next TBTT.
	 A value of 0 indicates that the switch occurs at any time after the
	 frame containing the element is transmitted.

4.   What is MLME state machine
Ans: MLME: Medium access control (MAC) sublayer management entity.
     This is the entity where the MAC state machines reside.
     Examples of states a MLME may assist in reaching:
      1. Authenticate
      2. Deauthenticate
      3. Associate
      4. Disassociate
      5. Reassociate
      6. Beacon
      7. Probe
      8. Timing Synchronization Function (TSF)

5.   Connection procedure and frame exchange
Ans: Access points are bridges that bridge traffic between mobile stations
     and other devices on the network. Before a mobile station can send
     traffic through an AP, it must be in the appropriate connection state.
     The three 802.11 connection states are:
      - Not authenticated or associated.
      - Authenticated but not yet associated.
      - Authenticated and associated.

     A mobile station must be in an authenticated and associated state before
     bridging will occur. The mobile station and AP will exchange a series of
     802.11 management frames in order to get to an authenticated and
     associated state.

     A mobile station starts out as not authenticated and associated.

     1. A mobile station sends probe requests to discover 802.11 networks
     within its proximity. Probe requests advertise the mobile stations
     supported data rates and 802.11 capabilities such as 802.11n. Because
     the probe request is sent from the mobile station to the destination
     layer-2 address and BSSID of ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff all AP's that receive it
     will respond.

     2. APs receiving the probe request check to see if the mobile station
     has at least one common supported data rate. If they have compatible data
     rates, a probe response is sent advertising the SSID
     (wireless network name), supported data rates, encryption types if
     required, and other 802.11 capabilities of the AP.
     A mobile station chooses compatible networks from the probe responses
     it receives. Compatibility could be based on encryption type.
     Once compatible networks are discovered the mobile station will attempt
     low-level 802.11 authentication with compatible APs.
     Keep in mind that 802.11 authentication is not the same as WPA2 or 802.1X
     authentication mechanisms which occur after a mobile station is
     authenticated and associated. Originally 802.11 authentication frames
     were designed for WEP encryption however this security scheme has been
     proven to be insecure and therefore deprecated. Because of this 802.11
     authentication frames are open and almost always succeed.

     3. A mobile station sends a low-level 802.11 authentication frame to an
     AP setting the authentication to open and the sequence to 0x0001.

     4. The AP receives the authentication frame and responds to the mobile
     station with authentication frame set to open indicating a sequence of
     0x0002.
     If an AP receives any frame other than an authentication or probe request
     from a mobile station that is not authenticated it will respond with a
     deauthentication frame placing the mobile into an unauthenticated an
     unassociated state. The station will have to begin the association
	 process from the low level authentication step. At this point the mobile
	 station is authenticated but not yet associated. Some 802.11 capabilities
	 allow a mobile station to low-level authenticate to multiple APs.
	 This speeds up the association process when moving between APs.
	 A mobile station can be 802.11 authenticated to multiple APs however it
	 can only be actively associated and transferring data through a single
	 AP at a time.

     5. Once a mobile station determines which AP it would like to
     associate to, it will send an association request to that AP. The
     association request contains chosen encryption types if required and
     other compatible 802.11 capabilities.
     If an AP receives a frame from a mobile station that is authenticated
     but not yet associated, it will respond with a disassociation frame
     placing the mobile into an authenticated but unassociated state.

     6. If the elements in the association request match the capabilties of
     the AP, the AP will create an Association ID for the mobile station and
     respond with an association response with a success message granting
     network access to the mobile station.

     7. Now the mobile station is successfully associated to the AP and
     data transfer can begin.

     Note: If WPA/WPA2 or 802.1X authentication is required on the wireless
     network, the mobile station will not be able to send data until dynamic
     keying and authentication have taken place after the 802.11 Association
     is complete.
