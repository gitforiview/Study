1.   When Wi-Fi was invent ?
Ans: In 1991, NCR Corporation with AT&T Corporation invented the precursor to 802.11, intended for use in cashier systems, under the name WaveLAN.

2.   What is significance of 802.11 ?
Ans: The first number, 802, is simply the IEEE’s number for the Committee of the IEEE that has been developing technical standards for local-area
     and metropolitan-area networks since February of 1980. (It is sometimes alleged that the number 802 comes from the date of first meeting of
     this committee, but I suspect this of being wishful thinking rather than grounded in fact.) This Committee handles all technical standards
     related to local and medium-distance networks.
     The second number, 11, reflects that wireless local area networks are the eleventh broad area in which this Committee has ventured.

4.   What is the difference between 2.4 GHz and 5GHz?
Ans: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz are simply different frequencies, and each has its advantages and disadvantages. The primary differences between the2.4GHz
	 and 5GHz wireless frequencies are range and bandwidth. 5GHz provides faster data rates at a shorter distance, whereas 2.4GHz offers coverage
	 for farther distances, but may perform at slower speeds. This article describes the differences between 2.4 GHz and 5GHz frequencies, and
	 offers suggestions for choosing the frequency that is best for your situation.

	 Range (how far your data can travel):
	 -------------------------------------
	 In most cases, the higher the frequency of a wireless signal, the shorter its range, or how far your data can travel, will be. The biggest
	 reason for this is that higher frequency signals cannot penetrate solid objects like walls and floors as well as lower frequency signals.
	 Thus, the 2.4 GHz has a farther range than the 5 GHz frequency.

	 Bandwidth (speed):
     ------------------
	 Higher frequencies allow faster transmission of data, also known as bandwidth. Higher bandwidth means that files will download and upload
	 faster, and high-bandwidth applications such as streaming video will perform much smoother and faster. Therefore,the 5GHz with its higher
	 bandwidth will provide much faster data connections than 2.4 GHz.

	 Interference:
     -------------
	 Many devices only use the 2.4 GHz frequency, and these devices are all attempting to use the same “radio space” which can cause overcrowding
	 of the channels. The 5GHz band has 23 available channels for devices to use vs. the 3 available on the 2.4 GHz band.

	 So, which should you choose, 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz?
	 	• If faster speeds are most important to you, 5GHz is usually a better choice than 2.4 GHz.
	    • If wireless range is more important to you, 2.4 GHz is usually a better choice than 5 GHz.
	 	• If you have a lot of devices that use 2.4 GHz and you are experiencing interference or intermittent connectivity issues, then 5GHz
	   	  is probably a better option.

5.   What do you understand by term Frequency, Bandwidth, wavelength.
Ans: Frequency:  Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time.
	             In terms of signals, The frequency of a wave is the number of waves produced by a source each second. It is also the number of
	             waves that pass a certain point each second. The unit of frequency is the hertz (Hz).

	 Bandwidth:  Bandwidth is the difference between the upper and lower frequencies in a continuous set of frequencies. It is typically measured
	             in hertz, and may sometimes refer to passband bandwidth, sometimes to baseband bandwidth, depending on context.

	 wavelength: In form of electromagnetic radio waves or light waves make characteristic patterns as they travel through space. Each wave has a
	             certain shape and length. The distance between peaks (high points) is called wavelength.
	             or
	             Wavelength is the distance between identical points in the adjacent cycles of a waveform signal propogated in space or along a
	             wire.

7.   Explain 802.11 Management Frames
Ans: Management Frames
	 802.11 management frames enable stations to establish and maintain communications. The following are common 802.11 management frame subtypes:

	 Authentication frame: 802.11 authentication is a process whereby the access point either accepts or rejects the identity of a radio NIC. The
	 NIC begins the process by sending an authentication frame containing its identity to the access point. With open system authentication (the
	 default), the radio NIC sends only one authentication frame, and the access point responds with an authentication frame as a response
	 indicating acceptance (or rejection). With the optional shared key authentication, the radio NIC sends an initial authentication frame, and
	 the access point responds with an authentication frame containing challenge text. The radio NIC must send an encrypted version of the
	 challenge text (using its WEP key) in an authentication frame back to the access point. The access point ensures that the radio NIC has the
	 correct WEP key (which is the basis for authentication) by seeing whether the challenge text recovered after decryption is the same that was
	 sent previously. Based on the results of this comparison, the access point replies to the radio NIC with an authentication frame signifying
	 the result of authentication.

	 Deauthentication frame: A station sends a deauthentication frame to another station if it wishes to terminate secure communications.

	 Association request frame: 802.11 association enables the access point to allocate resources for and synchronize with a radio NIC. A NIC
	 begins the association process by sending an association request to an access point. This frame carries information about the NIC (e.g.,
	 supported data rates) and the SSID of the network it wishes to associate with. After receiving the association request, the access point
	 considers associating with the NIC, and (if accepted) reserves memory space and establishes an association ID for the NIC.

	 Association response frame: An access point sends an association response frame containing an acceptance or rejection notice to the radio NIC
	 requesting association. If the access point accepts the radio NIC, the frame includes information regarding the association, such as
	 association ID and supported data rates. If the outcome of the association is positive, the radio NIC can utilize the access point to
	 communicate with other NICs on the network and systems on the distribution (i.e., Ethernet) side of the access point.

	 Reassociation request frame: If a radio NIC roams away from the currently associated access point and finds another access point having a
	 stronger beacon signal, the radio NIC will send a reassociation frame to the new access point. The new access point then coordinates the
	 forwarding of data frames that may still be in the buffer of the previous access point waiting for transmission to the radio NIC.

	 Reassociation response frame: An access point sends a reassociation response frame containing an acceptance or rejection notice to the radio
	 NIC requesting reassociation. Similar to the association process, the frame includes information regarding the association, such as
	 association ID and supported data rates.

	 Disassociation frame: A station sends a disassociation frame to another station if it wishes to terminate the association. For example, a
	 radio NIC that is shut down gracefully can send a disassociation frame to alert the access point that the NIC is powering off. The access
	 point can then relinquish memory allocations and remove the radio NIC from the association table.

	 Beacon frame: The access point periodically sends a beacon frame to announce its presence and relay information, such as timestamp, SSID, and
	 other parameters regarding the access point to radio NICs that are within range. Radio NICs continually scan all 802.11 radio channels and
	 listen to beacons as the basis for choosing which access point is best to associate with.

	 Probe request frame: A station sends a probe request frame when it needs to obtain information from another station. For example, a radio NIC
	 would send a probe request to determine which access points are within range.

	 Probe response frame: A station will respond with a probe response frame, containing capability information, supported data rates, etc., when
	 after it receives a probe request frame.
