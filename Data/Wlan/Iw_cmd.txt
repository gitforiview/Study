>	 What is iw command?
Ans: iw - show/manipulate wireless devices and their configuration. iw is a new
     nl80211 based CLI configuration utility for wireless devices. It supports
     all new drivers that have been added to the kernel recently. The old tool
     iwconfig, which uses Wireless Extensions interface, is deprecated and it's
     strongly recommended to switch to iw and nl80211. Some of iw commands

	    1)  iw list			//Getting device capabilities
	    2)  iw dev wlan0 scan		//Scanning
	    3)  iw event			//Listening to events
	    4)  iw event -f			//When debugging, it can be useful to see the
	                              auth/assoc/deauth/disassoc frames
	    5)  iw event -t			//timing information
	    6)  iw dev wlan0 link	//Getting link status -> To determine if you
	                              are connected to an AP or not and if you are
	                              the last TX rate used you can use the command
	                              below.
		7)  iw wlan0 connect foo		//Establishing a basic connection
		8)  iw wlan0 connect foo 2432   //Suppose you have two APs with the
		                                  SSID foo, and you know the one you
		                                  want to connect to is on the frequency
                    					  2432, you can specify the frequency.
	    9)  iw wlan0 connect foo keys 0:abcde d:1:0011223344    //To connect to
	                                                        an AP that uses WEP
	    10) iw dev wlan1 station dump	//To get station statistic information
	                     such as the amount of tx/rx bytes, the last TX bitrate 
					     (including MCS rate) 
	    11) sudo iw dev wlan1 station get <peer-MAC-address>	
	            //If you want to get specific statistics against a peer you station is 
				  communicating with
	    12) iw wlan0 set bitrates legacy-2.4 12 18 24	
	                                            //Modifying tx legacy bitrates
	    13) iw dev wlan0 set bitrates mcs-5 4	//Modifying tx HT MCS bitrates
	    14)iw dev wlan0 set bitrates mcs-2.4	
	                  //To clear all tx bitrates and set things back to normal:
	    15) iw dev <devname> set txpower <auto|fixed|limit> [<tx power in mBm>]	
	                                                //Setting TX power
	    16) sudo iw dev wlan0 set power_save on		//Power save
	    17) iw dev wlan0 get power_save	    
	                                //To query the current power save settings 
	    18) iw phy phy0 interface add moni0 type monitor
	                                //For example to add a monitor interface:
	    19) iw phy phy0 interface add wlan10 type managed
	           //to list all interfaces. To create a new managed mode interface
	    20) iw dev wlan0 interface add fish0 type monitor flags none
	        //Modifying monitor interface flags
		    >>	The following are flags you can specify as monitor interface flags
			    none
				fcsfail
				plcpfail
				control
				otherbss
				cook
				active
    	21) tcpdump -i fish0 -s 65000 -p -U -w  /tmp/fishing.dump	
    	            //You can then request the user to use tcpdump on a session
	    21) iw dev moni0 del				//Deleting interfaces with iw
	    22) sudo iwconfig wlp6s0 mode monitor
